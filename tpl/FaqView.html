    <h3>What is a pothole?</h3>
    <p>A pothole is a shallow pit or depression produced in a roadway surface by the effects of wear-and-tear and weather.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Why do potholes happen?</h3>
    <p>Potholes are created when water trickles and seeps through cracks in the asphalt that have developed over time as a result of heat 	and the constant pounding of vehicular traffic. As that moisture freezes and expands in the subgrade, sections of the pavement are loosened; when it melts and contracts, it leaves a void. This typically happens in spring with its freeze-and-thaw cycles.
	Traffic then exacerbates the problem. As vehicles travel over this weakened section of roadway, the pavement surface breaks and pieces of asphalt are forced out, collapsing and leaving a pothole. The hole gets bigger as cars and trucks roll over it. Most potholes develop in pavement that has seen some wear and tear, generally six to 12 years old and beyond. They can grow quite wide but usually only become a few centimetres deep. They are often round but pretty much come in a variety of shapes. Obviously, high-traffic roads tend to have the most potholes.</p>

    <h3>How you fix potholes?</h3>
    <p>Pothole repair is an important part of Public Operations' ongoing efforts to keep the municipality's roads safe and traffic flowing. The Road Maintenance Branch generally starts filling potholes on a regular basis in mid- to late March. A Patch Kat machine makes temporary repairs with a cold mixture of replacement material. An asphalt recycler that uses a hot mix of previously-used asphalt is deployed for permanent fixes. Repairs are ideally undertaken when the pavement is dry and the weather is warmer.</p>

    <h3>Why do some potholes reappear?</h3>
    <p>If a repaired pothole proves stubborn and reappears, it may be that it was fixed under less than ideal conditions. It may have had to have been taken care of on an emergency basis or in the winter for safety reasons during wet, cold weather, which is not conducive to lasting repairs.</p>

    <h3>What does a traffic signal do?</h3>
    <p>Traffic signals guide drivers and pedestrians through intersections and along roads. They tell road users when to stop and go, when and how to turn and when to drive with extra caution.</p>
    </div>
	
	<div data-role="collapsible">
    <h3>What should I do at dark signals?</h3>
    <p>During an electrical power loss, traffic lights at intersections will not work. Yield the right-of-way to vehicles in the intersection and to vehicles entering the intersection from your right. Go cautiously and use the intersection the same way you would use an intersection with all-way stop signs.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Do traffic signals reduce collisions?</h3>
    <p>Traffic signals may reduce the number of angle collisions; however, they can also increase other types of collisions such as rear-end collisions. The decrease in the more severe angle collisions is weighed against the likelihood of an increase in the number of the generally less severe rear-end collisions. If there is no history of angle collisions then traffic signals may increase the collision rate at an intersection.</p>
    </div>
	
	<div data-role="collapsible">
    <h3>Why aren't the signals timed so I never have to stop?</h3>
    <p>Traffic signals cannot give everyone a green light or walk signal all the time. Traffic signals are timed to move the most number of vehicles through an intersection and along a corridor in the most safe and efficient manner. This may result in longer delays for side street traffic; however, the overall delay at an intersection is reduced. There are also many other factors that impact the operation of the traffic signals. Closely spaced signals, intersections where major streets cross, changing traffic volumes and weather all add to the difficulty of minimizing stop and go traffic for all directions of travel. Fire trucks have the ability to change the signal to green or hold the green. This disrupts the timing patterns at intersections for as much as 10 minutes; therefore, the signals are impacted well after the fire vehicle has left the intersection.</p>

    <h3>Why do I have to wait when there's no one coming?</h3>
    <p>Many drivers ask why they have to wait so long for a signal to change. Many of these drivers are waiting to enter a major arterial street from a side street. This is even more frustrating when no traffic can be seen on the arterial. To allow the coordination of the arterial, the side street must wait until the main traffic movement on the arterial has gone through the intersection. It is possible that the arterial traffic can't be seen immediately, but will soon be passing through the intersection. Some signals, particularly in the downtown, don't have the necessary equipment to detect when cars are approaching. At other intersections the vehicle detection or pedestrian push button equipment may have failed. For both of these cases the traffic signal will cycle to the side street regardless if there are vehicles or pedestrians present. Pedestrian crossing times (Walk and Don't Walk) may require longer green intervals than the vehicles; therefore, the traffic signal may stay green when no vehicles are present. The impact of a fire truck on a traffic signal may be experienced even after the fire vehicle is out of sight.</p>

    <h3>What is a Bridge Condition Index and what do the ratings mean? When a bridge is rated "Poor", is the bridge safe?</h3>
    <p>A Bridge Condition Index (BCI) rating is a planning tool that helps the Ministry schedule maintenance and upkeep. The BCI is not used to rate or indicate the safety of a bridge. The result is organized into ranges from 0 to 100. Immediate action is taken to address any safety concerns. Good - BCI Range 70 -100 For a bridge with a BCI greater than 70, maintenance work is not usually required within the next five years. Fair - BCI Range 60 -70 For a bridge with a BCI between 60 and 70 the maintenance work is usually scheduled within the next five years. This is the ideal time to schedule major bridge repairs from an economic perspective. Poor - BCI Less than 60 For a bridge with a BCI rating of less than 60, maintenance work is usually scheduled within approximately one year.</p>

    <h3>What happens during a bridge inspection?</h3>
    <p>Bridges are inspected by or under the supervision of a professional engineer. The inspector assesses each bridge component to see if any repairs are needed. Any bridge repairs required to maintain safety are performed immediately.</p>
    </div>
	
	<div data-role="collapsible">
    <h3>How often are bridges inspected?</h3>
    <p>Provincial bridges undergo a general maintenance inspection at least twice a year.  This is in addition to a more detailed, bridge inspection every two years that is led or supervised by a trained, professional engineer.</p>
    </div>
	
	<div data-role="collapsible">
    <h3>What type of training is needed to be a bridge inspector?</h3>
    <p>A bridge inspector must be a professional engineer or a technician with bridge inspection experience. Additionally, bridge inspectors working for the Ministry of Transportation must complete the Ministry of Transportation bridge inspection course. During this course, inspectors are updated on what bridge components to inspect, how to inspect each component, how to identify a defect, how to record information from the inspection and how to make recommendations for bridge repairs. To ensure that inspectors are up-to-date on the latest in bridge safety, they are expected to attend this course every two years.</p>
